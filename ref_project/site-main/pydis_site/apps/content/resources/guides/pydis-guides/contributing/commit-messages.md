description: Information about logging in our projects.

A well-structured git log is key to a project's maintainability; it provides insight into when and *why* things were done for future maintainers of the project.

Commits should be as narrow in scope as possible.
Commits that span hundreds of lines across multiple unrelated functions and/or files are very hard for maintainers to follow.
After about a week they'll probably be hard for you to follow, too.

Please also avoid making minor commits for fixing typos or linting errors.
