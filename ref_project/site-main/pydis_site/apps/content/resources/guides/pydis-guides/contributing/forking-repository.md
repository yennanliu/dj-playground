Before contributing to any project, you will have to fork the project, ie. create your own online copy of the project.
The following will use the [Sir-Lancebot](https://github.com/python-discord/sir-lancebot/) repository as an example, but the steps are the same for all other repositories.

1. Navigate to the repository page and press the `Fork` button at the top of the page.

2. Fork it to your account.<br>

3. Later, you will need the Git URL of your forked repository in order to clone it.
In your newly forked repository, copy the Git URL by clicking the green `Code` button, then click the Copy Link button.

> If you have SSH set up with GitHub, you may instead click the `SSH` button above the Copy Link button to get the SSH URL.
