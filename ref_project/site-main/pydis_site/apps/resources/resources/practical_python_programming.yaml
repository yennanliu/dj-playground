  this course is a conversion of his instructor-led Python training course used for corporate training
  and professional development. It has been in continual development since 2007
  and battle tested in real-world classrooms. Usually, it’s taught in-person over the span of three
  or four days–requiring approximately 25-35 hours of intense work.
  This includes the completion of approximately 130 hands-on coding exercises.
