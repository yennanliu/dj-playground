    <p>
        The theme for code jam 5 was <strong>climate change</strong>.
        Similar to <a href="https://pythondiscord.com/pages/code-jams/code-jam-3/">code jam 3</a>,
        teams could live out their creativity here, as long as it fits the theme.
        The code jam started on July 20, 2019 at 12 PM UTC,
        and with more than 117 sign-ups and 27 teams competing,
        this was our biggest code jam ever (so far)!
    </p>

    <h2 id="task-description" class="title is-4"><a href="#task-description">Task Description</a></h2>
    <p>The original task description, as found in <a href="https://github.com/python-discord/code-jam-5">the repository</a>, was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Your theme for this code jam is <strong>climate change</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because this is a free-for-all, you are free to make anything you want,
            as long as it fits this theme.
            We'd love if you created something that might help raise awareness,
            but first and foremost, we want you to create something <i>fun</i>.
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="results" class="title is-4"><a href="#results">Results</a></h2>
    <p>
        While it was a difficult decision, the winners were Team <strong>Combined Crusader</strong>,
        consisting of Makusu, Mahabama, and missingfragment.
        They made a really addicting <i>Climate Clicker game</i> that surprised us for being extremely responsive,
        having beautiful, original art assets, and, most of all, being really fun to play.
        The code quality of this project was good and they used Pythonic techniques like the LRU cache to make the game behave extremely snappy.

    <h2 id="runner-up-1" class="title is-4"><a href="#runner-up-1">Runner up 1: Various Vipers</a></h2>
    <p>
        Team <strong>Various Vipers</strong> produced a game consisting of various mini-games that had an excellent graphical user interface.
        The fact that the project had accompanying game design documents showed how well-organized this project was.
        Combined with good code quality, this thematic project deserves the second place in this code jam.
    </p>
    <p>
        Feel free to check out their submission in the code jam <a href="https://github.com/python-discord/code-jam-5/tree/master/various_vipers">repository</a>

    <h2 id="runner-up-2" class="title is-4"><a href="#runner-up-2">Runner up 2: Gentle Gnomes</a></h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>Gentle Gnomes</strong> ended up in the third spot.
        Their web app allowed the user to search for a location and would then show climate-related statistics,
        plots as well as projections for the future for the specified location.
        The code quality of this project was outstanding and the web app was extremely useful and interesting.
