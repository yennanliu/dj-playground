    <p>Twice a year we host a code jam for members of our server to participate in. The code jam is an event where we place you
        in a team with 5 other random server members. You then have 8 days to code some sort of application or program in Python.
        Your program must use the specified technology/framework and incorporate the theme chosen by the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the 8 days is complete, your team has 3 days to finish documentation and create a video presentation showcasing
        and walking through the program that your team has created.
    </p>

    <h3 id="winners"><a href="#winners">Code Jam Winners</a></h3>
        <p>Congratulations to our winners and the two runner ups! Check out their projects below.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2"><i class="fa fa-trophy"></i> Perceptive Porcupines: WTPython!?</h4>
        <p class="my-1"><em>VV, Poppinawhile, ethansocal, Jeff Z, Cohan, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</em></p>
        <p class="my-1">
            What the Python (wtpython) is a simple terminal user interface that allows you to explore relevant answers on Stackoverflow without leaving your terminal or IDE. When you get an error, all you have to do is swap python for wtpython. When your code hits an error, you'll see a textual interface for exploring relevant answers allowing you to stay focused and ship faster!

        <p class="my-1"><em>A5Rocks, Bast, Dacheat, mega_hirtz, CopOnTheRun, richphi</em></p>
        <p class="my-1">
            Thinking inside a box, that is inside a box, that is inside yet another box.

            The terminal program created by the Lovable Lobsters allows you to play Ultimate Tic Tac Toe right form your terminal. The really impressive part though? You can play with your friends and family over your network! Their program has a server-client set-up that lets you play with your friends and family from different computers.

        <p class="my-1"><em>Björn, aaronshenhao, mathsman, Dude Saber, 詭異, Keppo</em></p>
        <p class="my-1">
            This submission is a Rubik's cube, rendered in a text user interface (that was a constraint) using the asciimatics package, and addressing the theme "thinking inside the box".

            Just like a real world Rubik's cube, you can move this cube around to look at it from all sides. And, of course, you can rotate the individual discs it is made up of to first scramble up the order and then to try and solve it into perfect ordering again.

    <h3 id="technology"><a href="#technology">Technology</a></h3>
    <p>
        The chosen technology/tech stack for this year is <strong>Text User Interfaces</strong> (TUIs).
        Each team must create a program with one of <a href="{% url "events:page" path="code-jams/8/frameworks" %}">the approved frameworks</a> that creates a user interface that is text based.
        For more information of TUIs and what's involved with such an interface, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this wikipedia article</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="qualifier"><a href="#qualifier">The Qualifier</a></h3>
    <p>
        The qualifier is a coding challenge that you are required to complete before registering for the code jam.
        This is meant as a basic assessment of your skills to ensure you have enough python knowledge to effectively contribute in a team environment.
    </p>
